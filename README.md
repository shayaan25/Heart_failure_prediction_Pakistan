Machine Learning Model to Predict Heart Failure in Pakistan

Hello! I am Shayaan, and in this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict heart failure based on patient data. The goal of this project is to achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 99%. The motivation behind this work stems from the fact that many individuals I know in Pakistan have suffered from heart failure. By creating a highly accurate prediction model, I hope to aid doctors in diagnosing and potentially saving lives.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: Mortality Rate Heart Patient Pakistan Hospital.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Model: Random Forest Classifier

Key Steps Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Imported the dataset and performed initial exploration and cleaning.
Handled missing values and transformed categorical variables.

Feature Selection and Engineering:

Selected relevant features that significantly contribute to the prediction of heart failure.

Model Training and Tuning:

Used GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters of the Random Forest Classifier.
Evaluated multiple models to select the best performing one.

Model Evaluation:

Achieved an accuracy of 98.65% with the initial model and 100% with the optimized model.
Utilized confusion matrices and classification reports to assess model performance.

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of 100%, with a perfect classification report and confusion matrix results. These outcomes demonstrate the model's effectiveness in predicting heart failure accurately based on the provided dataset.

Future Work

Validation: Validate the model on different datasets to ensure generalizability.
Deployment: Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to utilize the model in clinical settings.

Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kaggle for providing the dataset and the open-source community for developing the tools and libraries used in this project.
