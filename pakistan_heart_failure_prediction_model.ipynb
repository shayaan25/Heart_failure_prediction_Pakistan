    "# Machine learning model to predict heart failure in Pakistan\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! I am Shayaan and in this project I will be making a machine learning model that can predict if someone's heart is going to fail or not. I am aiming to achieve atleast 99% accuracy. The reason I chose to work on this is because a lot of people who I knew in Pakistan died of heart failure. I hope that if I can make a prediction model with high accuracy, doctors might be able to save people from dying due to heart failure.\n",
